# Transaction-Analysis
Transaction Analysis Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview:
The Transaction Analysis project aims to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing transactional data. 
The goal is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights into  behavior, transaction trends.
This project involves various data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the underlying structure of the data and derive actionable insights.

Dataset:
The dataset comprises transaction records, including fields such as TRANSACTION PARTICULARS, date, WITHDRWAL, DEPOSIT,BALANCE.

Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Correct data types for each column (e.g., date, numerical values).
Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
Standardize and normalize data as necessary.

Analyze transaction trends over time (monthly, yearly).

Tools and Techniques: -
                Python Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

numpy for numerical computations.

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

plotly for interactive visualizations.



Steps in the EDA Process:
Data Loading:
Load the transaction data into a pandas DataFrame.
Inspect the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values appropriately 
Correct data types and handle any inconsistencies.
Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.


Analyze and visualize payment method trends.

This project will provide a deep understanding of the transactional data, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
